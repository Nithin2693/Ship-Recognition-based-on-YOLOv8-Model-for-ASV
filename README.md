# Ship-Recognition-based-on-YOLOv8-Model-for-ASV
A real-time ship detection and classification system using YOLOv8, developed to enhance the autonomy of Autonomous Surface Vessels (ASVs). 
The model is trained on a multi-class maritime dataset under varying environmental conditions and achieves 98% classification accuracy.
The goal of this research is to develop an Efficient and accurate ship recognition is crucial for ASVs to identify and differentiate between different types of vessels in their surroundings. Autonomous Surface Vessels (ASVs) play a significant role in various maritime applications, including surveillance, search and rescue operations, environmental monitoring, and transportation. To introduce novel techniques for enhance the model's ability to generalize and accurately detect and recognize ships under different environmental conditions, such as varying lighting conditions, weather conditions, and viewing angles. 
This paper presents a ship recognition method based on the YOLOv8 model, aiming to enhance the autonomy and decision-making capabilities of ASVs. 
The proposed method leverages the You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8) object detection model, demonstrating exceptional performance in real-time object recognition tasks. 
By fine-tuning the YOLOv8 model on a large annotated dataset of ship images, we train it to recognize and classify various ship categories, such as Aircraft Carrier, Bulkers, Car Carrier, Container, Ship, Cruise, DDG, Recreational, Sailboat, Submarine, and Tug. The experimental evaluation of the proposed method is conducted on a diverse dataset comprising thousands of ship images captured from different perspectives and in various environmental conditions.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately identifying and classifying ships, with an accuracy of 98%. 
The latency at the inference time is a major challenge while using this model in such a time-critical application. However, the proposed model using YOLOv8 outperformed other object detection models.
The ASV utilizes the classification results to make informed decisions based on the type of ship encountered, such as adjusting its trajectory, determining potential collision risks, or adapting its behaviour to comply with maritime regulations.
